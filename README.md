#  Sonia's Research - 
**An Analysis of the Spread and Transmission of COVID-19 in the United States Through Spatial Mobility Data Using a Network Model**

# Motivation
For the last year and a half I have been a Research Assistant for Dr. Philip Brown at the University of Colorado Colorado Springs writing Python code to explore and understand the spread and transmission of the COVID-19 virus in the United States. A few months ago, we bagan compiling all the work that I had done into a paper with the hopes that it will be published. This repository contains all of the Jupyter Notebooks and CSVs discussed in the report so that anyone can replicate both our research and our results.
